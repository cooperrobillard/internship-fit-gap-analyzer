# Learning Log

This file tracks what I am building, what I am learning, where AI helped, and what I still need to understand better.

The goal of this project is not just to create a finished repo. The goal is to improve my actual understanding of Python, file handling, data structures, and eventually tools like pandas, SQLite, APIs, testing, and documentation.

## 2026-05-29 — Project setup and basic file loading

### What I built

* Set up the first version of the `internship-fit-gap-analyzer` project.
* Created the main folder structure with `data/`, `src/`, `tests/`, `README.md`, and `LEARNING_LOG.md`.
* Added my resume as a text file in `data/resume/resume.txt`.
* Added sample job descriptions in `data/jobs/`.
* Added a skills taxonomy in `data/skills_taxonomy.json`.
* Wrote code in `src/main.py` to:

  * read my resume text,
  * read the skills taxonomy JSON file,
  * read job description `.txt` files,
  * print previews in the terminal.

### What I practiced

* Using `Path` to point to files and folders.
* Reading text files with `.read_text(encoding="utf-8")`.
* Reading a JSON file as text.
* Using `json.loads()` to turn JSON text into a Python dictionary.
* Using `.glob("*.txt")` to find text files in a folder.
* Using a `for` loop to go through job description files.
* Printing previews with string slicing like `resume_text[:500]`.

### Bugs or issues I worked through

* I originally used `.read_text()` too early and accidentally stored the whole resume text in a variable that was supposed to be a file path.
* That caused Python to treat my whole resume as a file name.
* I also tried to loop directly through a `Path("data/jobs")` folder, which caused a `TypeError` because a plain folder path is not automatically a list of files.
* I fixed this by using `.glob("*.txt")` to get the job files.

### What AI helped with

* AI helped explain the error messages.
* AI helped show the correct file-reading pattern.
* AI helped explain what each line was doing.
* I copied some corrected code, but I am going line by line to understand how the pieces fit together instead of just pasting blindly.

### What I understand now

* A file path points Python to where a file or folder is.
* `Path("data/resume/resume.txt")` points to my resume file but does not read it yet.
* `.read_text(encoding="utf-8")` opens the file and reads the contents as text.
* JSON files can be loaded into Python dictionaries.
* A folder path is different from a group of files.
* `.glob("*.txt")` finds all text files in a folder.
* `main.py` is currently acting as the control script that loads the project inputs.

### What I still want to understand better

* How imports work between files inside the `src/` folder.
* How to organize code into separate helper files.
* How to make the terminal output cleaner.
* How to turn the printed output into an actual markdown report.

## 2026-05-29 — Added simple skill matching

### What I built

* Added a `find_skills(text, taxonomy)` function in `src/extract_keywords.py`.
* This function searches a piece of text for skills listed in the taxonomy.
* Updated `src/main.py` so it can find skills in:

  * my resume,
  * each job description.

### What I practiced

* Writing a function.
* Passing information into a function with parameters.
* Returning a result from a function.
* Using `.lower()` to make text matching easier.
* Looping through a dictionary with `.items()`.
* Looping through lists of skills.
* Using `if skill in text` to check whether a skill appears.
* Using `.append()` to add found skills to a list.
* Importing a function from another file.

### What AI helped with

* AI helped write the first clean version of the `find_skills()` function.
* AI helped add comments so I could understand each line.
* I am focusing on understanding what the function does, what inputs it needs, and what it returns.

### What I understand now

* `find_skills()` takes two inputs: text and the taxonomy dictionary.
* The text can be either my resume or a job description.
* The taxonomy is a dictionary where each category has a list of skills.
* The function returns a new dictionary showing which skills were found.
* `extract_keywords.py` is a helper file, while `main.py` controls the workflow.

### What I still want to understand better

* How to avoid false matches from simple keyword matching.
* For example, `java` could accidentally match inside `javascript`.
* How to compare job skills against resume skills.
* How to save the results instead of only printing them.

## 2026-05-29 — Current project state

### What currently works

* The project can read the resume text file.
* The project can read the skills taxonomy JSON file.
* The project can read multiple job description files.
* The project can find basic keyword skill matches in the resume and job descriptions.
* The output currently prints to the terminal.

### What is not built yet

* Comparing job skills against resume skills.
* Creating a markdown gap report.
* Saving results to CSV.
* Using pandas.
* Using SQLite.
* Using the OpenAI API.
* Building a Streamlit dashboard.
* Adding tests.

### Next step

* Build a simple comparison function in `src/compare_resume.py`.
* The function should compare skills found in a job description against skills found in my resume.
* The goal is to identify skills that appear in the job but not in the resume.

## 2026-05-29 — Generated first markdown gap report

### What I built
- Added `src/report_writer.py`.
- Created a `write_gap_report(output_path, resume_skills, job_results)` function.
- Updated `src/main.py` to collect job analysis results and write them into `data/outputs/gap_report.md`.

### What I practiced
- Creating a report-writing helper file.
- Passing dictionaries and lists into a function.
- Building a markdown file as text.
- Using `.append()` to add sections to a list.
- Using `"".join(lines)` to combine many text sections into one report.
- Using `.write_text()` to save text to a file.
- Creating an output folder with `.mkdir()`.

### What AI helped with
- AI helped structure the report writer and explain each line.
- I copied the code, but I reviewed the comments to understand how the report is built from the resume skills and job results.

### What I understand now
- `main.py` controls the full workflow.
- `extract_keywords.py` finds skills in text.
- `compare_resume.py` finds gaps between job skills and resume skills.
- `report_writer.py` turns the results into a markdown report.
- The project now has a basic input → analysis → output flow.

### What I still want to understand better
- How to make the report cleaner and easier to read.
- How to save results to CSV.
- How to avoid false keyword matches.
